## 🌟 Description
Step into the future of web apps with this robust Text Editor crafted to meet the standards of Progressive Web Applications (PWA). With an emphasis on offline reliability and efficient data storage, this editor ensures that your notes and code snippets are securely saved and easily accessible. This application makes use of cutting-edge technologies such as the idb package for data management and features a streamlined deployment process for Heroku.
