## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
1. Using the Text Editor (Powered by JavaScript and Next-gen ES6+ features):
- Start typing or pasting your text into the editor area. You don't need to manually save your work! As you type or when you click outside the text editor window, your content gets automatically saved in the secure storage backed by IndexedDB ‚Äì a powerful browser-based database.

2. Saving Your Content (Enhanced with IndexedDB):
- If you close the text editor and return later, you'll find your content right where you left it, thanks to the efficient retrieval system utilizing IndexedDB for persistent, offline storage.
3. Revisiting and Retrieving Content (Progressive Web App Features):
- Spot the "Install" button, typically found at the top or bottom of the page.Clicking this button leverages the Web App Manifest and Service Workers allowing you to download the web application for offline use. It will appear as an icon on your desktop or device's home screen, just like native apps.
